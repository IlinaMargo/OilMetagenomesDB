# OilMetagenomesDB - Samples Column Specifications

![check_dataset paasing](https://img.shields.io/badge/check__dataset-passing-brightgreen)

This page describes columns definitions for all sample-level lists. Icons indicate columns
that are specific to specific columns.

- üèû: oilfield environmental metagenomes
- ü¶†: crude oil metagenomes

Numeric fields (e.g. latitude), can be filled with `NA` to indicate 'no
reported value'. Free text fields (e.g. `geo_loc_name`) can be indicated with
`Unknown`, and restricted cateogory columns sometimes will have an `unknown`
option.

All column with 'defined categories' should be validated against
`assets/enums/<column>.json`. This is to ensure data consistency, e.g. all
Dental calculus samples are listed as `dental calculus` (as defined in
`assets/enums/<column>.json`). This is to ensure data consistency.

If you wish to a new category, please consult with the [SPAAM
community](spaam-community.github.io), and then add it to
`assets/enums/<column>.json`.

Sample columns are as follows:

## project_name

- Format: `SurnameYYYY` (YYYY in numeric format)
- Due to restrictions in regex (used for validation checks), **punctuation (e.g.
  hyphens or spaces) or characters with accents cannot be used**.
  - Use the non-accented version (e.g. √£ or √§ become a).
  - If the first author has multiple or hyphenated surnames, write them all
    together capitalising each surname.
- If a same author/year combination already exists, please append a single lower
  case character (b,c,d etc.) to the key.
  - The already existing key does not need to be updated. `b` indicates the
    'second' key added.
  - e.g. Muhlemann2018 (original), Muhlemann2018b (first duplicate),
    Muhlemann2018c (second duplicate) etc.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory value

## study_primary_focus

> üèû environmental ancient metagenome only!

- The primary 'organism' category that the sequences was originally generated for
- These are generalised categories such as 'floral', or 'faunal', 'microbial',
  with a combination of those (in that order) also allowed.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è this does NOT necessarily imply that the data can only be used for
> the same purposes. This column is only to facilitate faster bibliographic
> review for equivalent dataset generation

## sequence_name

> üèû environmental ancient metagenome only!

- Sediment cores only
- Identifier for sequence sample was taken from, e.g. core_3, or zone_a19
- Typically cores, or quadrant/square of excavation
- Missing value: `Unknown`

## depth

> üèû environmental ancient metagenome only!

- Sediment only
- Depth of sample from top of sequence (cm)
- If reported as a range (e.g. 130-132 cm), take approximate mid-point
- Use NA if not a sequence (e.g. from surface of an open site)

## sample_name

- Unique identifier for that sample as used in publication
  - In most cases this should be the name of the host _individual_ (for host-associated samples)
  - If samples are referred to by multiple names, use the most informative
  - For environmental samples: if samples cannot be **directly** linked to data files by any names in the publication, generate names in the format e.g. [sequence]\_[depth]\_[original_name]

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory value

## feature

> üèû environmental ancient metagenome only!

- Description of the object, site, or immediate environment the sample was obtained from, following [Environment
  Ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo)
  - e.g. midden, cave, ocean, lake, archeological site

> ‚ö†Ô∏è partly [MIxS v5](https://gensc.org/mixs/) compliant field, following
> [Environment Ontology](http://www.environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Must follow categories specified in `assets/enums/<column>.json`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory value

## material

- Sample type DNA was extracted from

  - e.g. dental calculus, palaeofaeces, intestinal, chewing gum
  - e.g. permafrost, lake sediment, peat soil, bone
  - e.g. tooth, bone, dental calculus

- For host-associated single genome list only:
  - If genome is derived from multiple tissue types from the same individual (e.g. bone and soft tissue) then the entry should simply be listed as 'tissue'

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Partly [MIxS v5](https://gensc.org/mixs/) compliant field, i.e. term
> from an [ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index), and ideally either
> [UBERON](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon) (anatomy) or
> [ENVO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo) (everything else). If you
> can't find something close enough, please ping
> @spaam-community/ancientmetagenomedir-coreteam

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Must follow categories specified in `assets/enums/<column>.json`

## sampling_date

> üèû environmental metagenome only!

- Year of sampling of (sub-)sample for DNA analysis in YYYY format
- Missing value: `NA`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è [MIxS v5](https://gensc.org/mixs/) compliant field

## archive

- The archive the sample's data is stored on.
  - Should be an established long-term stable archive
  - Generally set up academic institutions e.g. EBI or Universities (rather than companies, e.g. GitHub)
- e.g. [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena),
  [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), [OAGR](https://www.oagr.org/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Must follow categories specified in `assets/enums/<column>.json`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory value

## archive

- In most cases should correspond to the `archive` of the publication in the
  corresponding sample metadata table!
- The archive the library's data is stored on.
  - Should be an established long-term stable archive.
  - Generally set up academic institutions e.g. EBI or Universities (rather than
    companies, e.g. GitHub).
- e.g. [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena),
  [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), [OAGR](https://www.oagr.org/).
- In some cases this will vary, for example if there IS an ERS code, however
  only consensus sequences are uploaded

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Must follow categories specified in `assets/enums/<column>.json`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory value

## archive_project

- A project level accession code under which all samples of a project are assigned to
- Specific examples:

  - Archive: ENA/SRA/DDBJ: should be _primary_ accession code beginning with `PRJ`. [Example](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA438985).
  - Archive: MG-RAST: should be accession code beginning with `mgp`. [Example](https://www.mg-rast.org/mgmain.html?mgpage=project&project=mgp13354).
  - Archive: Dryad/FIGSHARE etc.: use the dataset's overall DOI as archive project accession.

- Missing value: `Unknown`

## archive_accession

- Of _sample_, where possible
- For ENA/SRA: These should be **secondary** accession IDs to keep as close to
  data as possible (e.g. SRS, ERS, not SAMEA - see below)
- If non-NCBI/ENA, use as close to sample-level as possible
  - e.g. for Dryad/Figshare, use the numeric ID after 'file_steam' in the per-file download URL
- Multiple can be separated with commas
  - e.g. when different extracts of one sample incorrectly uploaded as samples
